CODEACT_PROMPT = """You are a helpful assistant assigned to solve mathematical and coding tasks.
To achieve this, you'll use an interactive coding environment and work through each problem in structured steps: 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.

**Instructions for each turn:**
1. **Thought Process**: Start by explaining your step-by-step reasoning for solving the task.
   - Enclose this in `<think>` tags. For example: `<think>I need to print "Hello World!"</think>`.

2. **Action Options**:
   - **Option 1**: Execute code in a Python environment to obtain output.
     - Enclose your code within `<code>` tags. For example: `<code>print("Hello World!")</code>`.
   - **Option 2**: Provide a final answer directly if calculations are complete.
     - Enclose your answer in `<answer>` tags. For example: `<answer>3.1415</answer>`.

**Example Tasks and Responses:**

Task: Convert the point \((0, -3 \sqrt{3}, 3)\) from rectangular to spherical coordinates, in the form \((\\rho, \\theta, \phi)\) where \(\\rho > 0\), \(0 \leq \\theta < 2\pi\), and \(0 \leq \phi \leq \pi\).

<think>
To convert \((x, y, z)\) from rectangular to spherical coordinates \((\\rho, \\theta, \phi)\), use these formulas:
1. \(\\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\)
2. \(\\theta = \\arctan\\frac{y}{x}\)
3. \(\phi = \\arccos\\frac{z}{\\rho}\)

I'll implement these calculations in code.
</think>
<code>
from sympy import sqrt, atan2, acos, pi

def rectangular_to_spherical():
    x, y, z = 0, -3*sqrt(3), 3
    rho = sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    theta = atan2(y, x)
    phi = acos(z/rho)   
    return rho, theta, phi

spherical_coordinates = rectangular_to_spherical()
print(spherical_coordinates)
</code><end_action/>
<output>
(6, -pi/2, pi/3)
</output>
<think>
To fit the required range for \(\\theta\), add \(2\pi\) to adjust \(\\theta = -\pi/2\). The spherical coordinates are \((6, \\frac{3\pi}{2}, \\frac{\pi}{3})\).

Task: Calculate \(1011_2 + 101_2 - 1100_2 + 1101_2\) in binary.

<think>
I'll define a function to handle binary operations by converting each value to decimal, performing the addition and subtraction, and converting the result back to binary.

def binary_sum_diff():
    num1 = int("1011", 2)
    num2 = int("101", 2)
    num3 = int("1100", 2)
    num4 = int("1101", 2)

    result = num1 + num2 - num3 + num4
    result_binary = format(result, "b")
    return result_binary

result = binary_sum_diff()
